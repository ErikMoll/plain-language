This standard aims to streamline the creation and sharing of digital health cards for vaccination and testing status, particularly during infectious disease outbreaks or pandemics. It provides a blueprint for representing essential clinical data in a secure, verifiable format.

The standard focuses on data minimization and privacy, offering two profile sets: one for minimal data and another for more comprehensive information. It uses specific FHIR profiles for resources like Patient, Immunization, and Observation, ensuring consistent coding of vaccines and test results.

Key features include a mechanism to indicate identity assurance levels and guidance on minimizing payload size for QR code embedding. The standard aligns with the [SMART Health Cards](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/smart-health-cards-and-links) specification and privacy regulations like HIPAA and GDPR.

Primary users include healthcare providers, pharmacies, labs, and government agencies issuing health cards; patients who receive and present these cards; and entities verifying vaccination or testing status, such as airlines and employers.

This approach enables individuals to easily prove their health status while protecting their privacy. It offers a standardized method for creating interoperable digital health cards that can be widely recognized and verified.
