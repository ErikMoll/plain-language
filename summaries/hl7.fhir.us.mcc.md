This standard aims to improve care for patients with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) in the United States. It provides a framework for creating electronic care plans that can be easily shared and updated by healthcare providers, patients, and caregivers.

The standard focuses on capturing comprehensive patient information, including medical conditions, treatments, goals, and social factors that affect health. It allows healthcare teams to create more coordinated and personalized care plans for complex patients.

Key features include:
- Structured data elements for representing MCC care plans
- Integration of social determinants of health information
- Support for patient-generated data and goals
- Ability to link related health information dynamically

This standard aligns with U.S. healthcare regulations and data exchange requirements. It enables healthcare providers to create more holistic care plans, supports better communication among care team members, and allows patients to be more actively involved in their care planning. The structured data format also facilitates using this information for research and public health initiatives related to chronic disease management.
