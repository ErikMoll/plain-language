This standard aims to facilitate the exchange of essential patient health information across international borders, primarily for unplanned care situations. It provides a framework for creating and sharing minimal yet clinically relevant patient summaries, enabling healthcare providers in different countries to access critical information during emergencies or unexpected visits.

The standard focuses on a core set of patient data, including allergies, medications, problems, immunizations, procedures, and results. It uses SNOMED CT as the primary terminology, promoting interoperability and multilingual support. The standard allows for flexibility by permitting the inclusion of additional data elements beyond the minimal dataset.

Key features include mandated human-readable narrative text for each section, ensuring comprehensibility in different languages, and recommended operations for generating and accessing patient summary documents.

This standard benefits healthcare providers by facilitating access to essential patient information during cross-border care scenarios. Patients benefit from seamless transfer of critical health information when receiving care in different countries. Healthcare systems can standardize patient summary exchange, fostering interoperability.

The standard aligns with international specifications for patient summaries and addresses privacy and security considerations.
