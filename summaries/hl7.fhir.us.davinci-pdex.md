This standard, called Payer Data Exchange (PDex), aims to improve how health insurance companies share patient data in the United States. It focuses on three main scenarios: sharing data with healthcare providers, transferring information when patients switch insurance plans, and allowing patients to access their health data through authorized apps.

PDex uses FHIR to structure health information consistently. It provides guidance on converting insurance claims data into clinical formats and introduces new ways to record medication dispensing. The standard also supports bulk data transfers for efficiency.

Key features of PDex include secure authorization methods, data traceability, and custom profiles for specific types of health information. It directly supports recent U.S. healthcare regulations that require insurance companies to make patient data more accessible through APIs.

Patients benefit from better-coordinated care and easier access to their health records. Healthcare providers can access more complete patient histories. Insurance companies can streamline their data sharing processes and meet regulatory requirements. App developers can create new tools that use patient health data securely.

PDex aligns with U.S. healthcare privacy laws and supports national efforts to improve health data interoperability.
