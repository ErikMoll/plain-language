# General

US Core is a set of rules and best practices that help healthcare providers share patient information safely and efficiently across the United States. It uses the FHIR standard to align how data —such as patient records, medications, and lab results — is formatted and exchanged. These rules follow federal requirements, especially [USCDI](https://www.healthit.gov/isp/united-states-core-data-interoperability-uscdi), ensuring hospitals and clinics share the most critical health data. US Core includes security measures like [SMART on FHIR](https://hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/) to protect privacy, which controls who can access sensitive information.  

This standard makes it easier for doctors to get a complete view of a patient’s health, helps patients manage their medical records, and allows developers to create apps that work with different healthcare systems. Researchers also benefit because they can collect consistent data for studies. By providing a common way to share health information, US Core improves care coordination, supports patient engagement, and advances medical research nationwide.
