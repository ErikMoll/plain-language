This standard, known as US Core, defines how healthcare data should be exchanged in the United States using FHIR. It specifies which data elements are required and how they should be formatted for key clinical information like patient details, medications, and lab results. US Core aligns with federal regulations, particularly the U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI), which mandates what data healthcare systems must be able to share.

US Core includes security features to protect patient privacy, such as [SMART on FHIR](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/smart-app-launch) for controlling data access. It also provides guidance on specific healthcare scenarios, like sharing clinical notes or medication lists.

The standard benefits various groups. Healthcare providers can access more complete patient information. Patients gain better control over their health data. Software developers can create applications that work across different healthcare systems. Researchers can more easily collect standardized data for studies.

By providing a common framework for health data exchange, US Core aims to improve care coordination, support patient engagement, and advance medical research in the United States.
