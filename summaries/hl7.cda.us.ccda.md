# General

This guide helps healthcare providers and software developers share health information in the United States using a format called Clinical Document Architecture (CDA). C-CDA uses CDA XML to structure clinical documents, such as patient summaries and discharge notes. C-CDA has been required by federal regulations since 2012. While it is an older standard compared to [FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html), it is still widely used, with over 1 billion documents exchanged every month [Carequality](https://carequality.org/). Because of this widespread use, the standard is updated annually to ensure systems using C-CDA meet government certification rules.

C-CDA helps coordinate care by making sure important health information is available when and where it is needed.  If you work on healthcare IT systems that uses CDA for information exchange, this guide is essential for meeting national standards and improving patient care.
