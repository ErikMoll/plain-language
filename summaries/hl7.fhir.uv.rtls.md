This standard aims to improve how Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS) in healthcare settings share information with other systems. It focuses on communicating the location of tracked items, such as medical equipment or even patients, within a hospital or similar facility.

The standard defines specific events that trigger communication between the RTLS and other systems. These include enrolling a new tag, removing a tag, and updating a tag's location. It uses FHIR resource profiles to structure this information, ensuring consistency across different systems.

By standardizing this communication, the guide helps healthcare organizations improve their workflows and efficiency. For example, it can make it easier to locate important equipment quickly or track patient movements through a facility.

Healthcare IT developers will use this standard to create systems that work seamlessly with RTLS solutions. Healthcare organizations benefit from the improved ability to track and manage their resources. While not explicitly stated, this standardization may also contribute to better patient care through more efficient operations.
