This standard aims to improve data sharing between healthcare and human services in the United States. It extends FHIR's Patient resource to create a new profile called "MyPatient," which includes additional data elements specific to social services needs. The standard addresses gaps in existing healthcare data frameworks to better incorporate human services information, enabling a more holistic approach to care.

Developed in alignment with the HHS Data Strategy, this standard promotes integrated care and improved human services program delivery. It focuses on creating data standards, identifying gaps, and developing use cases and tools to address these gaps. The standard emphasizes collaboration with standards-setting organizations and ensures that human services standards remain open and accessible.

Primary users include implementers of health information technology systems in human services settings, such as social service providers, government agencies, and technology vendors. By adopting this standard, these users can enhance data exchange between human services and healthcare organizations. This improved data sharing ultimately benefits individuals and families receiving human services through more coordinated and effective service delivery.
