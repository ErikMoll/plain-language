This standard aims to bring advanced subscription features from newer versions of FHIR to older systems. It addresses limitations in previous approaches, such as scalability issues and lack of detailed notifications. The standard introduces a topic-based model, allowing healthcare software to define specific events that trigger notifications. It also enhances the subscription resource, improving clarity and flexibility in subscription requests.

Key features include restructured notifications that provide richer, more informative updates, and support for various notification delivery methods like REST-hook, WebSockets, and email. The standard offers flexibility in payload types, balancing data detail with security considerations.

Healthcare software developers can use this standard to implement improved subscription capabilities in their existing systems without needing a full upgrade. This potentially enables healthcare providers to receive more timely and informative notifications about relevant patient data changes. The standard's improvements in data synchronization and notification mechanisms support better interoperability and data exchange in healthcare settings.
