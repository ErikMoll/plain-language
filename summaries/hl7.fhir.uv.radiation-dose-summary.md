This standard focuses on simplifying the exchange of radiation dose information from medical imaging procedures. It addresses the need for a lightweight method to share essential dose data between radiology systems, EHRs, and dose management platforms.

The standard defines a set of minimal dose information to be shared, covering various imaging modalities like CT scans, X-rays, mammography, and nuclear medicine. It outlines how this data should be structured and exchanged using FHIR resources.

Healthcare providers, particularly radiologists, benefit from easier access to dose information for reporting and patient care. Healthcare systems can integrate dose summaries more efficiently, improving workflow and potentially enhancing radiation safety practices.

The standard aligns with existing DICOM imaging practices and emphasizes compliance with local and regional regulations on radiation dose reporting. It provides a streamlined approach for systems to obtain crucial dose data without processing complex DICOM reports, making it easier for healthcare organizations to meet reporting requirements and manage patient radiation exposure.
