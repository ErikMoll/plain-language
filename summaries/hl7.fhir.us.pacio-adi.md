This standard aims to improve how advance healthcare directives are shared between healthcare systems in the United States. It focuses on enabling the exchange of patients' medical care preferences, especially when they cannot communicate these wishes themselves.

The standard covers three types of advance directive information: patient-authored documents, medical orders for life-sustaining treatment, and future support for encounter-specific instructions. It defines how to represent this information using FHIR resources and provides guidance on creating, sharing, querying, updating, and revoking advance directives.

Key features include support for different document formats, recommendations for digital signatures, and alignment with [US Core](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/hl7.fhir.us.core) profiles for national consistency. The standard also emphasizes security and privacy measures, including the use of encryption and proper recording of data provenance.

Patients benefit from having their care wishes respected across different healthcare settings. Healthcare providers gain easier access to critical information for making informed decisions. Healthcare IT developers can use this standard to create interoperable systems for managing advance directives.

The standard aligns with Medicare signature requirements and references existing [CDA](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/hl7.cda.uv.core) documents for advance directive exchange, ensuring compatibility with current practices.
