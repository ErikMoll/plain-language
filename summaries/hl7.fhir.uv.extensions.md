This standard focuses on defining and managing extensions and terminology within FHIR. It provides a structured approach for adding custom data elements to FHIR resources and managing code systems and value sets for specific data fields. This allows FHIR to be adapted to diverse healthcare contexts and use cases that require information not covered in the base specification.

The standard maintains a registry of extensions with a common base URI, promoting discoverability and reuse. It also includes mechanisms for defining and managing terminology, ensuring consistent use of standardized codes for data exchange. Additionally, it provides guidance on defining validation rules for questionnaires using [FHIRPath](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/FHIRPath) expressions, allowing for data quality checks and enforcement of specific requirements.

Health IT developers use this standard to create and use extensions tailored to specific needs, while also relying on terminology resources for consistent code usage. Healthcare organizations benefit from improved interoperability and data exchange within their systems and with external partners. Data analysts and researchers can more easily interpret and compare data from different sources due to standardized extensions and terminology.
