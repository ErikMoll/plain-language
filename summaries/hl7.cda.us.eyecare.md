This standard aims to improve how eyecare data is shared electronically between healthcare systems. It focuses on capturing key information from eye exams, such as visual acuity, refraction, diagnostic tests, and posterior segment observations, in a consistent format.

The standard uses [Clinical Document Architecture](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/[CDA](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/CDA-core-sd)-core-sd) (CDA) templates as a foundation, specifically adapting the Physical Exam section for eyecare. It organizes related eye exam observations into groups and uses SNOMED CT codes to ensure consistent terminology for tests, methods, and findings.

Specific templates and value sets are defined for various aspects of eye exams, including visual acuity, refraction, and diagnostic tests like dry eye assessments. The standard also provides examples of how to structure this information within clinical documents.

Primary users of this standard include developers of EHRs and other health IT products used in eyecare. Business analysts and policy managers involved in eyecare data management may also find it useful. By promoting consistent data representation, the standard aims to facilitate better information exchange between different eyecare providers and systems.
