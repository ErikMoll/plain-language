This standard aims to streamline the reporting of health care survey data to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) in the United States. It focuses on automating data collection from hospitals and ambulatory care settings for national surveys like the National Hospital Care Survey and the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey.

The standard leverages FHIR and APIs to enable more efficient data collection compared to previous manual or claims-based methods. It utilizes SMART on FHIR for secure authorization and the MedMorph Reference Architecture for automating reporting workflows. The standard aligns with US Core profiles to ensure data consistency across healthcare systems.

Key beneficiaries include healthcare providers, who experience reduced reporting burdens, and the NCHS, which receives higher quality and more timely data. Health IT developers also benefit by having clear guidelines for building data exchange applications.

By automating data collection, this standard supports initiatives like the Promoting Interoperability program, which encourages the use of EHRs and standardized data exchange in healthcare settings.
