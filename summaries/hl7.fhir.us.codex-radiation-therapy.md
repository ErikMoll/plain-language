This standard aims to improve the sharing of radiation therapy information in healthcare. It provides a structured way to represent and exchange data about radiation treatments, including prescriptions, plans, and delivered treatments. By standardizing key elements like treatment intent, modality, technique, dose, and fractionation, it enables consistent documentation and analysis of radiation therapy across different systems.

The standard benefits multiple stakeholders. Patients can receive better coordinated care as their radiation therapy information becomes more easily shareable among their care team. Radiation oncology providers can efficiently document and share treatment details with other healthcare professionals. Researchers gain access to standardized data, facilitating comparative studies and outcomes analysis.

This standard aligns with existing oncology data frameworks like [mCODE](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-mCODE-ig) (minimal Common Oncology Data Elements) and IHE-RO XRTS (Exchange of Radiotherapy Summaries). It leverages established medical terminologies such as SNOMED CT and DICOM. While not directly addressing specific regulations, the structured data it produces can support reporting requirements from organizations like the Commission on Cancer.
