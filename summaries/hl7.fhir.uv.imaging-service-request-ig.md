This standard aims to improve how healthcare systems manage and share information about imaging orders, such as X-rays or CT scans. It focuses on helping Radiology Information Systems and Picture Archiving and Communication Systems exchange data using FHIR.

The standard defines how to represent key information from imaging orders using FHIR resources. This includes details about the patient, their visit, the specific order, and the imaging procedure to be performed. It provides a structured way to create, update, and cancel orders, as well as query for related information.

By standardizing this process, the guide helps reduce manual data entry and improves workflow efficiency for healthcare providers like radiologists and technicians. It also makes it easier for different healthcare IT systems to work together seamlessly.

The standard aligns closely with existing imaging workflows that use the DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) standard, particularly its Modality Worklist service. This ensures compatibility with current practices while enabling the benefits of FHIR-based communication.

Healthcare IT developers can use this standard to create more integrated and efficient systems for managing imaging orders and procedures.
