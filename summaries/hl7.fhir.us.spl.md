This standard aims to modernize how pharmaceutical companies submit drug label information to the FDA in the United States. It replaces the older HL7 V3 SPL format with FHIR, offering a more flexible and web-friendly approach to structuring drug label data.

The standard defines specific data requirements for drug label submissions using FHIR resources. It also provides tools to convert existing SPL data into FHIR and vice versa, ensuring compatibility with legacy systems. The standard covers real-world FDA processes such as requesting labeler codes, registering establishments, and submitting drug labels.

Pharmaceutical companies benefit from a simplified and standardized way to submit drug label data electronically to the FDA. The FDA gains efficiency in processing and accessing drug label information, enabling better data analysis and regulatory oversight. Healthcare professionals may find it easier to access accurate and up-to-date drug label information, potentially enhancing patient care and safety.

This standard directly supports FDA requirements for drug label submissions, aiming to streamline compliance and modernize data handling within the agency.
