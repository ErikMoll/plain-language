This standard aims to improve hypertension management by facilitating the exchange of self-measured blood pressure (SMBP) data between personal devices, patient apps, and EHRs in the United States. It defines specific data structures for SMBP readings, average measurements, and associated heart rate. The standard outlines workflows for data exchange between patients, clinicians, devices, and healthcare systems.

Key features include FHIR profiles for SMBP data, extensions for additional information like measurement counts, and value sets for controlled vocabularies. It also provides detailed scenarios of data exchange interactions and defines expectations for FHIR servers and clients implementing the standard.

Patients can easily share their SMBP readings with healthcare providers, enabling more effective remote monitoring and treatment adjustments. Clinicians receive structured SMBP data, allowing for better-informed decision-making. Health centers can integrate this data into their systems, potentially improving overall hypertension management and patient outcomes.

The standard aligns with [US Core](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/US-Core), Vital Signs, and Personal Health Device guidelines, as well as clinical recommendations from organizations like the American Heart Association and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
