This standard aims to improve how continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data is shared between different healthcare systems in the United States. It focuses on enabling easier and more reliable exchange of CGM data, including both detailed glucose readings and summary reports, to enhance diabetes management.

The standard defines specific ways to represent various types of CGM data, such as sensor readings, summary reports, and device information. It outlines a process for submitting CGM data to EHRs, including steps for app authorization, patient identification, and data packaging. The standard also introduces CGM Data Submission Standing Orders, allowing EHRs to specify their preferences for data submission frequency and content.

Key beneficiaries include patients, who can more easily share their CGM data with new providers or research studies, and healthcare providers, who gain access to comprehensive CGM information for making treatment decisions and remote monitoring. Diabetes management platforms and apps can use this standard to integrate seamlessly with EHRs and other healthcare systems. Researchers benefit from standardized data formats that simplify the collection and analysis of CGM data from multiple sources.
