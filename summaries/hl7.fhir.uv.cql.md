# General

[Clinical Quality Language (CQL)](http://cql.hl7.org) is a computer programming language used for decision support, public health reporting, and research/trial eligibility criteria.

This standard defines ways to use CQL with FHIR (as the most general purpose way to access healthcare information systems consistently). Healthcare providers can use this standard to share the rules that support clinical decision-making and quality reporting with each other, and software developers get clear guidelines for building systems that support this.

Sharing this knowledge leads to economies of scale and better healthcare outcomes for less cost.
