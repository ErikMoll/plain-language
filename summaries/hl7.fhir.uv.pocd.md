This standard aims to improve how point-of-care medical devices in acute care settings share data with other healthcare systems. It focuses on standardizing detailed measurements, device status, and device architecture information. The standard uses a device-centric data model that represents complex devices with their subsystems and channels, reflecting real-world organization.

Key features include the use of "deep metadata" to provide more context about device observations, a standardized device model based on IEEE 11073, and comprehensive data archiving capabilities. The standard also incorporates the IEEE 11073-10101 nomenclature for coding device-related concepts and provides guidance on mapping data from existing HL7 v2 device interfaces.

Clinicians benefit from richer device data for improved decision-making, while implementers of healthcare systems can use the standard to integrate device data into EHRs and clinical decision support systems. Device developers can create products that share data seamlessly, and clinical engineers can utilize detailed device information for better management and maintenance. Researchers also gain access to comprehensive device data for clinical studies and analysis.
