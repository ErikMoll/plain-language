This standard aims to improve how healthcare systems manage patient consent for accessing health data. It focuses on creating, reviewing, signing, sharing, and revoking consent across multiple organizations or systems.

The standard defines specific use cases and introduces custom FHIR profiles to structure consent data consistently. It suggests the potential need for custom FHIR operations to support advanced consent management tasks and emphasizes tracking the history of consent events.

Patients benefit from more consistent and transparent management of their consent, giving them greater control over who can view their information. Healthcare providers can implement standardized consent workflows to ensure compliance with regulations and patient wishes. Health Information Exchanges can use the standard for interoperable consent management across different systems.

The standard aligns with HIPAA regulations and builds upon existing FHIR resources to address consent management more comprehensively. It provides guidance for developers creating consent management solutions or integrating consent features into existing systems.
