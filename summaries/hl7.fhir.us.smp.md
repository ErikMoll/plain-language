This standard aims to improve the exchange of medication information when patients move between healthcare settings, especially to and from post-acute care facilities like nursing homes. It focuses on creating a standardized way to share crucial details about a patient's medications electronically.

The standard uses FHIR resources to structure medication data and promotes consistent terminology to ensure clear communication across different systems. It outlines how healthcare systems should interact to exchange this information using APIs.

Key beneficiaries include clinicians who can access complete medication lists during care transitions, patients who can be better informed about their medications, and post-acute care facilities that can receive structured medication data electronically. Pharmacies can also benefit from access to comprehensive medication histories.

By improving the exchange of medication data, this standard helps healthcare organizations meet patient safety goals related to medication reconciliation. It aligns with broader US healthcare interoperability efforts, ensuring that shared information is consistent with national standards.

Overall, this standard seeks to reduce medication errors, improve communication between healthcare providers, and enhance patient safety during care transitions.
