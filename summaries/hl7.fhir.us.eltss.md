This standard aims to improve the exchange of electronic Long-Term Services and Supports (eLTSS) data in the United States. It focuses on creating comprehensive, patient-centered care plans that integrate various aspects of eLTSS, such as goals, services, risks, and financial information.

The standard centers around the FHIR CarePlan resource, linking all eLTSS data elements to it. It utilizes resource referencing to connect various FHIR resources, reducing redundancy and promoting data reuse. The standard also defines specific extensions to accommodate eLTSS-specific data elements.

Key beneficiaries include healthcare providers, patients receiving long-term services and supports, and state agencies responsible for eLTSS programs. Providers will be able to better coordinate care and make informed decisions, while patients may experience improved care coordination.

The standard aligns with US Core standards, promoting interoperability with other healthcare systems. It also references security guidelines from US Core, demonstrating adherence to industry best practices for data privacy and security.
