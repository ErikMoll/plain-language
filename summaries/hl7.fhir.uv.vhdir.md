This standard aims to improve the accuracy and accessibility of healthcare provider information. It focuses on creating a centralized, validated directory of healthcare providers and organizations using FHIR. The standard defines how to structure and exchange data about practitioners, organizations, locations, and services.

Key features include a process for validating provider information against primary sources and a read-only API for accessing the verified data. Users can search for specific provider details using various parameters.

The standard benefits healthcare organizations, government agencies, and indirectly, patients. Payers, providers, and health information exchanges can access reliable provider data for operations, care coordination, and claims processing. Regulatory agencies can use the data for monitoring and compliance purposes.

While not defining the submission process, the standard offers guidance on how providers and organizations can attest to their information for inclusion in the directory. This approach aims to reduce administrative burden and improve overall data quality in the healthcare system.
