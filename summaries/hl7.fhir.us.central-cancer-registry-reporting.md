This standard aims to automate and streamline cancer reporting from healthcare providers to central cancer registries in the United States. It defines a method for EHRs to automatically send cancer-related information to registries, making the process faster and more accurate.

Cancer reporting is legally mandated in the US, but current processes often involve manual data extraction, leading to delays and potential errors. This standard addresses these issues by leveraging FHIR for data exchange.

Key features include the use of FHIR resources to represent cancer-related information, a subscription system for automatic notifications when reportable events occur, and a Health Data Exchange App that processes data and submits reports to registries. The standard also emphasizes adherence to security guidelines and HIPAA regulations to protect patient data.

This approach benefits central cancer registries by providing timely, standardized data for improved surveillance and research. Healthcare providers can reduce manual reporting burdens, while EHR vendors and technology developers can create systems that support automated cancer reporting workflows.

The standard aligns with [US Core](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/hl7.fhir.us.core) profiles, the mCode standard for cancer data exchange, and the [MedMorph](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/hl7.fhir.us.medmorph) framework for public health reporting. It directly addresses legal requirements for cancer reporting in the USA.
