This standard aims to improve how healthcare quality data is exchanged and reported in the United States. It addresses challenges in value-based care models where efficient data sharing between providers, payers, and quality programs is crucial.

The standard defines specific ways to structure and transmit quality measure data using FHIR. It introduces specialized profiles and resources like MeasureReport to organize data exchange. Key features include operations for submitting and collecting data, querying payers about measure requirements, and reporting gaps in care.

Healthcare providers benefit from reduced reporting burdens and improved care gap management. Payers gain access to consistent quality data for performance evaluation. Quality reporting programs receive standardized information for efficient analysis.

The standard aligns with [US Core](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/hl7.fhir.us.core) profiles and supports reporting to programs like MIPS and Hospital Quality Reporting. It also references the HEDIS Implementation Guide for specific measure examples.

By standardizing quality data exchange, this approach aims to enhance interoperability, streamline reporting processes, and ultimately contribute to improved healthcare quality and outcomes.
