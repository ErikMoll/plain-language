This standard aims to improve the sharing of breast imaging reports between healthcare providers and systems. It defines how to represent key information from mammograms, ultrasounds, and other breast imaging tests using FHIR. The standard covers important details like the location and characteristics of findings, assessment categories (such as BI-RADS scores), and recommendations for follow-up care.

By using common medical terminologies and codes, the standard ensures that breast imaging data can be consistently understood across different healthcare settings. This can help streamline communication between radiologists, surgeons, and oncologists involved in breast cancer screening and treatment.

The standard's primary users are healthcare providers working in breast imaging and cancer care. Its adoption could lead to more efficient sharing of test results, potentially supporting faster diagnosis and treatment planning. While not explicitly stated, the standardized data format might also prove valuable for breast cancer research and public health initiatives in the future.
