This Implementation Guide outlines how individuals can use **SMART Health Cards** and **SMART Health Links** to manage and share their health information. SMART Health Cards enable people to carry verifiable digital or paper copies of specific records, like official vaccination histories or lab test results, often as a scannable QR code for situations requiring proof of authenticity. SMART Health Links allow for the secure sharing of more extensive or evolving data, such as a complete immunization history or ongoing lab results, through a special web link; to control access, these links can be protected by a passcode that the individual provides to the recipient. This framework is designed to handle both formally attested clinical facts where verification is crucial, and other useful health-related content where convenient access and communication are the main goals.

To enable these capabilities, the guide provides the complete technical rules for software developers and health organizations. It details how to correctly format all types of data, apply robust security measures like digital signatures and encryption (especially for verifiable information), manage the processes for issuing Cards and for systems to retrieve information via Links, and properly handle the associated QR codes. Adherence to these specifications ensures that different systems can consistently, securely, and inter-operably produce, exchange, and process information using SMART Health Cards and Links.
