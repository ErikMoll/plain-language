This standard aims to streamline electronic referrals between healthcare providers and community-based organizations (CBOs) in the United States. It focuses on referrals for patients with chronic conditions who need support beyond traditional healthcare, such as diabetes prevention programs or tobacco cessation services.

The standard emphasizes data minimization, sending only necessary information to protect patient privacy and comply with HIPAA. It also promotes closed-loop feedback, allowing referring providers to receive updates on patient progress.

Key features include defined FHIR profiles for structuring referral information, a clear workflow with defined states (e.g., created, accepted, completed), and support for both push-based and pull-based communication methods. The standard is designed to be adaptable for future referral types and changing requirements.

Healthcare providers benefit from easier referral processes and improved care coordination. CBOs can seamlessly receive referrals and report on service delivery outcomes. Health Information Exchanges can act as intermediaries, facilitating secure information exchange. Ultimately, patients benefit from better care coordination and improved access to community-based services.

The standard aligns with [US Core](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/hl7.fhir.us.core) FHIR profiles and the IHE Patient Care Coordination Technical Framework, ensuring compatibility with established interoperability frameworks.
