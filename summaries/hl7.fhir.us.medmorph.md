This standard aims to simplify and automate how healthcare data is collected and shared for public health reporting and research in the United States. It creates a system that automatically extracts relevant data from healthcare providers' records and sends it to public health agencies and researchers.

The standard introduces "Knowledge Artifacts," which are like digital instructions that tell the system what data to collect and when to send it. A backend service called the Health Data Exchange App processes these instructions, monitors for specific events in patient care, and submits reports automatically.

Key features include the use of FHIR APIs for data exchange, tools for protecting patient privacy, and a system that can trigger data reporting based on specific clinical events. This approach reduces the workload for healthcare providers, improves data quality, and speeds up the sharing of important health information.

Public health agencies benefit from more timely and complete data for disease surveillance and outbreak response. Researchers gain easier access to standardized clinical data for studies. Healthcare providers spend less time on administrative tasks related to data reporting.

The standard aligns with U.S. healthcare regulations, including the ONC 21st Century Cures Act and HIPAA Privacy Rule, ensuring that data sharing is both efficient and compliant with privacy laws.
