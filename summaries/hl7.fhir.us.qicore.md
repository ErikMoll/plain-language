QI-Core is a collection of definitions and profiles that facilitates the sharing of information across healthcare. It provides guidance on the structure of data to be used in healthcare systems that support Clinical Decision Support (CDS) and Quality Measurement. Since QI-Core is based on US Core and FHIR resources, it is also able to support use cases outside of CDS and quality measurement.

Clinical decision support (CDS) and quality measurement are two key parts of healthcare that work together to enhance patient care:

- **Clinical decision support (CDS)** tools help healthcare providers make better choices about patient care. They offer information, reminders, and guidelines right when doctors, nurses, and others need them.
- **Quality measurement** involves checking how well healthcare services are working. It may include looking at whether treatments are effective, if patients are happy with the care they received, or if there are mistakes in the care provided.

Together, CDS and quality measurement ensure that patients receive the best possible care.
