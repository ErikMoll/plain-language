QI-Core is a collection of definitions and profiles that facilitates the sharing of information across healthcare. It provides guidance on the structure of data to be used in healthcare systems that support Clinical Decision Support (CDS) and Quality Measurement. QI-Core describes expectations for software systems that exchange healthcare data for the purpose of measuring and improving the quality of healthcare in the United States using FHIR. QI-Core extends US Core to support exchanges that are focused on clinical quality improvement, such as facilitating shared decision-making between patients and providers, determining whether care providers are following established best practices, and measuring care provider and insurance plan performance and effectiveness.

Clinical decision support (CDS) and quality measurement are two key parts of healthcare that work together to enhance patient care:

- **Clinical decision support (CDS)** tools help healthcare providers make better choices about patient care. They offer information, reminders, and guidelines right when doctors, nurses, and others need them.
- **Quality measurement** involves checking how well healthcare services are working. It may include looking at whether treatments are effective, if patients are happy with the care they received, or if there are mistakes in the care provided.

Together, CDS and quality measurement ensure that patients receive the best possible care.
