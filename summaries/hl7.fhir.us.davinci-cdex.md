This standard aims to improve how healthcare providers and insurance companies exchange clinical data in the United States. It focuses on allowing insurers to request specific patient information from providers, rather than receiving large amounts of unnecessary data.

The standard outlines three main ways to exchange information:

1. Direct queries where insurers can search provider systems for exact data
2. A task-based approach for requesting data that may need human review
3. A method for sharing medical attachments related to claims or prior authorizations

These approaches help reduce administrative work for healthcare providers and protect patient privacy by limiting data sharing to what's truly needed. Insurers benefit from more efficient access to clinical information, which can streamline processes like claims management and quality reporting.

The standard aligns with existing US healthcare regulations and data requirements. It emphasizes patient privacy, data security, and only sharing the minimum necessary information. By improving data exchange, this standard aims to support better care coordination and more accurate health assessments for patients.
