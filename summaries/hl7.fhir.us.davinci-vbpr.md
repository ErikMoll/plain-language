This standard aims to streamline the exchange of value-based performance reports between healthcare payers and providers in the United States. It addresses the challenge of inconsistent reporting formats by establishing a common framework for sharing data on cost and quality metrics in value-based care models.

The standard defines key profiles for reporting overall performance, quality measures, and contract information. It uses extensions to include specific details like payment streams and thresholds, and provides value sets for consistent coding of performance metrics and related concepts.

By standardizing these reports, the guide helps reduce administrative burden for both payers and providers. Payers can generate uniform reports across different value-based payment models, while providers can more easily analyze and compare their performance data from multiple payers.

The standard aligns with existing healthcare frameworks, including the Health Care Payment Learning & Action Network's Alternative Payment Model categories. This ensures compatibility with various value-based payment approaches currently in use.
