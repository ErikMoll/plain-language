This standard aims to improve how healthcare systems represent and exchange information about a person's sex and gender. It provides guidelines for accurately capturing gender identity, sex for clinical use, recorded sex or gender from official documents, preferred names, and pronouns.

The standard is designed for use by healthcare providers, organizations, researchers, and government agencies. It offers clear technical specifications for implementing these concepts in various healthcare data formats.

Key features include the use of standardized terminologies and flexible data structures to enable seamless information exchange between different systems. The standard defines minimum value sets for gender identity and pronouns while allowing for local extensions based on cultural and regional needs.

By implementing this standard, healthcare systems can provide more respectful and accurate representation of patients' sex and gender information. This leads to better clinical decision-making, more personalized care, and improved data quality for research and public health reporting.

The standard aligns with initiatives by organizations like the World Health Organization and addresses issues raised by the U.S. Office of the National Coordinator regarding sex and gender representation in healthcare data.
