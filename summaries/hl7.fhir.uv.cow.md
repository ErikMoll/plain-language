This standard focuses on improving how healthcare orders are handled electronically. It aims to streamline the process of creating, communicating, and fulfilling medical orders across different healthcare settings. The standard provides guidelines for structuring order information to ensure that all necessary details are available to those who need to carry out the orders.

Key features include methods for assembling comprehensive order content upfront and ways to retrieve specific information when needed. It considers the relationship between those placing orders (like doctors) and those fulfilling them (such as pharmacists or lab technicians) to determine how information should be shared.

The standard is designed to be used by developers of healthcare IT systems, including EHRs, pharmacy systems, and laboratory information systems. By providing a consistent approach to handling orders, it aims to reduce errors and improve efficiency in healthcare delivery.

Healthcare professionals benefit from clearer communication and more complete information when dealing with orders. This can lead to faster and more accurate order fulfillment, potentially improving patient care and safety.
