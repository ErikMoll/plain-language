This standard introduces FHIR Shorthand (FSH), a specialized language for creating and managing FHIR artifacts. FSH simplifies the development of FHIR standards, making the process more efficient and user-friendly. It offers a concise, text-based approach that is easier to understand than editing raw FHIR data formats.

Key features of FSH include its domain-specific syntax tailored for defining FHIR components, and the SUSHI compiler that transforms FSH code into FHIR artifacts. FSH integrates with existing FHIR tools, streamlining the standard creation process.

The primary users of FSH are healthcare professionals and technical experts who develop FHIR standards. By simplifying this process, FSH indirectly supports healthcare organizations and vendors implementing FHIR-based solutions. The standard's text-based nature allows for easy editing, version control, and collaboration among development teams.

FSH aligns with broader healthcare interoperability initiatives promoted by organizations like HL7 and ONC. Its goal is to enhance the efficiency of creating FHIR standards, ultimately contributing to improved healthcare data exchange and interoperability.
