This standard aims to improve how electronic Product Information (ePI) for medications is shared internationally. It establishes a structured method for exchanging detailed drug information using FHIR and common medical terminologies. The standard supports three types of ePI documents with varying levels of detail, from basic product lists to comprehensive clinical use information.

Key features include the use of 13 FHIR resources to represent different aspects of medication data, adherence to accessibility guidelines, and compatibility with standard medical terminologies like MedDRA and SNOMED CT. The standard also allows for national profiles to meet local regulatory requirements.

By moving away from unstructured PDFs, this approach enables more efficient searching, personalization, and integration of medication information with other health systems. This benefits patients by providing easier access to up-to-date, tailored drug information. Healthcare professionals can more quickly find comprehensive medication details to support prescribing and dispensing. Regulators gain a standardized format for processing ePI, while software developers can create interoperable solutions for managing and exchanging this information.
