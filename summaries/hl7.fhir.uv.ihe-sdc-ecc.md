This standard aims to improve how electronic Cancer Protocols (eCPs) are shared and used in healthcare. eCPs are detailed forms used by pathologists to record cancer data. The standard outlines how to convert eCP data into FHIR resources, making it easier to exchange information between different health systems.

Key features include methods for packaging and transmitting eCP data, using standard medical terminologies, and extracting structured information from the forms. This approach supports important use cases like cancer registry reporting and clinical research.

Pathologists benefit from more efficient data capture and reporting. Cancer registries receive more structured and complete information, aiding public health surveillance. Researchers can more easily analyze standardized data for studies and quality improvement. Healthcare providers gain access to more comprehensive patient information, potentially improving clinical decisions.

The standard is based on FHIR R4 and builds upon the IHE Structured Data Capture ([SDC](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/hl7.fhir.uv.sdc)) Technical Framework. It specifically supports public health reporting requirements, such as those for cancer registries.
