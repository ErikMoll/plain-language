This standard establishes a clear framework for defining and managing Value Sets in healthcare information systems. Value Sets are crucial for ensuring data consistency, as they specify the allowable codes for specific data elements in healthcare messages. The standard provides a structured model for describing Value Sets, including metadata, scope, and a Content Logical Definition (CLD). It introduces a machine-processable expression for determining the codes in a Value Set Expansion and supports both algorithmic and enumerated definitions.

Key features include a standardized approach to Value Set versioning, a default syntax for expressing the CLD, and flexibility to support different implementation needs. The standard consolidates terminology concepts previously scattered across various healthcare standards, promoting semantic interoperability and efficient data exchange.

This approach benefits terminology system designers, healthcare standard implementers, and subject matter experts by providing a consistent method for creating and managing Value Sets. Healthcare organizations can improve data quality and interoperability by adopting this standard, potentially leading to more effective healthcare delivery and data analysis.
