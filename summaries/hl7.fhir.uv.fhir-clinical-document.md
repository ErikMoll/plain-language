# General 

This standard helps healthcare systems share clinical documents, like discharge summaries and progress notes, in a clear and consistent way using FHIR (a health data standard). It defines how to build these documents using FHIR so that they work across different hospitals and clinics around the world.

The main idea is to create a document that people can read and that computers can use. It uses a structure called a "Bundle" that includes important parts like the main document (called a Composition) and other related health information. It also includes ways to track versions of a document and show which ones are the latest.

This standard gives clear instructions for how to:
- Format the documents
- Add extra details when needed
- Update or replace documents over time
- Convert documents into a format that can be processed by FHIR servers

Doctors, healthcare organizations, and health IT developers can use this to create and share clinical documents more easily. It helps different systems work together (called interoperability) and supports moving from older systems (like CDA) to newer FHIR-based ones.
