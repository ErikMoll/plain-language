This standard aims to streamline how pharmaceutical companies submit drug product application information to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It focuses specifically on the Pharmaceutical Quality/Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (PQ/CMC) section of applications. The standard uses FHIR to structure this data, making it easier for the FDA to process and review electronically.

The standard introduces a phased approach, grouping different aspects of PQ/CMC information into stages for gradual implementation. It utilizes various FHIR resources to represent different data elements and employs profiles to ensure consistency and compliance with FDA requirements. A narrative transform tool helps convert XML files into XHTML format for each profile.

This standard aligns with international guidelines, particularly the Common Technical Document (CTD) and electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) formats. It also adheres to relevant FDA regulations.

Key beneficiaries include FDA reviewers, who can more efficiently analyze structured PQ/CMC data, and pharmaceutical companies, who benefit from a more streamlined application process. The standard also provides a clear framework for software vendors developing systems to support PQ/CMC data exchange.
