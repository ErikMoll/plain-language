This standard aims to improve how physical activity data is shared between healthcare systems in the United States. It focuses on creating a consistent way to exchange information about patients' exercise routines, fitness goals, and related health metrics.

The standard defines specific formats for care plans, goals, service requests, and observations related to physical activity. It uses common medical coding systems and introduces new codes where needed to ensure all relevant concepts can be accurately captured.

Key features include the ability to create and share physical activity care plans, set and track fitness goals, manage referrals to services like personal trainers or gyms, and record progress over time. The standard also outlines how different systems, such as EHRs and patient apps, should interact when exchanging this data.

Patients benefit from better coordination of their fitness activities across healthcare providers and services. Doctors and care managers can more easily monitor patient progress and adjust plans. Fitness professionals can seamlessly receive referrals and report back on client achievements.

By providing a unified approach to handling physical activity data, this standard supports improved patient care and collaboration among all parties involved in a person's fitness journey.
