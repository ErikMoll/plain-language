This standard aims to improve integration between EHRs and third-party apps within a clinician's workflow. It enables tighter user interface integration and allows apps to communicate with EHRs in new ways, beyond what was previously possible with the SMART on FHIR API.

The standard leverages HTML5 Web Messaging for secure communication between apps and EHRs. It defines methods for apps to interact with temporary FHIR resources within the EHR's "scratchpad," such as draft orders. It also allows apps to signal completion or request the EHR to navigate to specific activities, enhancing overall integration.

Key benefits include improved workflow integration, access to draft resources, and bidirectional communication between apps and EHRs. This results in smoother transitions and more efficient interactions for clinicians.

The standard is primarily useful for clinicians, app developers, and EHR vendors. It aligns with CDS Hooks naming conventions and utilizes OAuth 2.0 for secure authorization and access control.
