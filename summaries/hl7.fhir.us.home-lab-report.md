This standard aims to improve how at-home in-vitro test results are reported digitally in the United States. It provides a framework for developers to create apps that capture, organize, and transmit test results from patients to healthcare providers and public health agencies.

The standard supports various types of at-home tests, including multiplex tests that can diagnose multiple conditions with a single kit. It uses specific elements to capture supporting information, such as answers to questions asked during test reporting, which provides valuable context for public health surveillance.

To address the lack of a central database for at-home testing, the standard recommends packaging all relevant information into a single bundle for transmission. It also emphasizes the use of unique identifiers for sending applications, test kits, and other entities.

Key beneficiaries include patients, who can easily share their results; healthcare providers, who receive timely and accurate information; and public health agencies, who can more efficiently monitor and respond to health trends. App developers also benefit from clear guidelines for creating standardized reporting tools.

This standard builds upon existing [US Core](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/US-Core) profiles, promoting compatibility with EHR systems and improving overall data exchange in healthcare.
