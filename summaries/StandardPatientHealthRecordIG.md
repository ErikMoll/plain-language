This standard aims to create a unified format for Personal Health Records (PHRs), allowing patients to gather and securely share their complete medical history. It introduces the '.sphr' file format, which uses FHIR resources to represent various health information, including demographics, conditions, medications, and observations.

The standard emphasizes patient ownership and control over health data, aligning with the 21st Century Cures Act's patient access provisions. It recommends robust security measures, including encryption, to ensure data confidentiality and integrity. The standard also supports efficient handling of large datasets through NDJSON format for export and import.

Patients benefit by being able to compile and manage their comprehensive medical history, facilitating informed healthcare decisions. Healthcare providers can access complete patient records, improving diagnosis, treatment planning, and care coordination. PHR developers receive clear guidance for creating interoperable applications, fostering innovation in the PHR ecosystem.

The standard provides example patient journeys and synthetic data to guide developers in modeling realistic scenarios. It references and aligns with relevant FHIR standards, including US Core and Argonaut profiles, as well as specialized standards for genomics and radiology.
