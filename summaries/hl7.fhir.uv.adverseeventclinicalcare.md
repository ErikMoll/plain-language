This standard aims to improve how adverse events are recorded and shared in clinical care settings. It provides a structured format for capturing detailed information about adverse events, including the patient affected, the event itself, potential causes, and actions taken. This is particularly useful for incident reporting and enhancing patient safety.

The standard defines specific data elements essential for clinical incident reporting, such as the subject (patient or group), recorder, participants, suspected causes, and mitigating actions. It also specifies constraints on the types of data allowed for certain elements.

Healthcare providers, organizations, pharmacies, and pharmaceutical companies can use this standard to document and report adverse events more effectively. The standardized data can also support researchers and public health agencies in analyzing trends and developing preventive strategies.

By providing a consistent approach to adverse event reporting, this standard helps healthcare professionals and organizations improve their patient safety practices and reduce potential harm.
