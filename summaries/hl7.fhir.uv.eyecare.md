This standard, called "Eyes on FHIRÂ®", aims to improve how eye care data is shared and used in healthcare. It focuses on creating specific guidelines for representing ophthalmology information using FHIR.

The standard defines how to record and exchange data for common eye care scenarios, such as cataract surgery and glaucoma management. It creates specialized profiles for eye-specific measurements like visual acuity and intraocular pressure. The standard also establishes common terminology and value sets for describing eye conditions, procedures, and observations.

By providing clear rules for data representation, this standard helps ensure that different systems can accurately share and interpret eye care information. This benefits ophthalmologists, optometrists, researchers, and patients by enabling more efficient data exchange and collaboration.

The standard incorporates existing medical coding systems like SNOMED CT, ICD-10, LOINC, and CPT. This approach ensures compatibility with broader healthcare data initiatives and supports improved interoperability in eye care.
