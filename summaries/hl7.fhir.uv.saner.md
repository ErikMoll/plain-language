This standard, called SANER (Situational Awareness for Novel Epidemic Response), aims to improve how hospitals and healthcare facilities report critical resource data to public health agencies during emergencies like pandemics. It focuses on automating the collection and transmission of information about bed availability, ventilator use, and patient outcomes.

SANER uses modern technology to overcome challenges faced by older systems, which often relied on manual data entry. It allows for more efficient, accurate, and timely reporting from various health IT systems, including EHRs and bed management solutions.

The standard employs a flexible architecture that can integrate with existing healthcare IT infrastructure. It defines specific ways to represent important concepts like bed types and ventilator status, ensuring consistency across different facilities.

Public health officials benefit from SANER by receiving up-to-date data to monitor situations and allocate resources effectively. Healthcare facilities gain a streamlined reporting process, reducing manual work. The standard also addresses privacy concerns by recommending security measures to protect sensitive information.

By providing a standardized approach to emergency resource reporting, SANER aims to improve overall response efforts during public health crises, ultimately benefiting patient care.
