This standard aims to synchronize healthcare applications in real-time, allowing different systems like EHRs, imaging viewers, and dictation tools to display the same patient information simultaneously. It uses a publish-subscribe model to send notifications about context changes, such as opening a patient chart, to connected applications.

FHIRcast defines specific events for common clinical workflows, triggering actions across multiple systems. It primarily uses WebSockets for efficient real-time communication and leverages [SMART on FHIR](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/hl7.fhir.uv.smart-app-launch) for secure application launch and authorization.

The standard benefits clinicians by providing a unified view of patient data across multiple systems, streamlining their workflow. Healthcare application developers can more easily integrate their products with other systems using FHIRcast's standardized approach.

FHIRcast builds upon earlier synchronization models but offers a simpler, more developer-friendly solution. It uses FHIR resources to structure and exchange clinical context information, ensuring interoperability between different healthcare applications.
