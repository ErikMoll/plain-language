This standard aims to improve how digital systems share information about human and social services in the United States. It focuses on standardizing data about services like food banks, transportation assistance, and mental health counseling. The standard defines specific FHIR profiles for Organizations, Locations, and HealthcareServices tailored for human and social service data. It also specifies an API for querying human services directories.

The standard builds upon the Human Services Data Specification (HSDS), making it easier for systems already using HSDS to adopt. It aligns with relevant healthcare standards like [US Core](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/hl7.fhir.us.core) and the Gravity Project's SDOH standard, ensuring compatibility.

Healthcare providers can use this standard to find and refer patients to appropriate social services. Insurance companies can incorporate social service referrals into care management programs. Consumers can use mobile apps to search for and access social services in their communities.

This standard is designed to meet requirements outlined in the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access Rule, which mandates standardized API access to provider directories, including social service providers. It also leverages US Core profiles, which are based on the United States Core Data for Interoperability ([USCDI](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/hl7.fhir.us.core)).
