This standard aims to streamline how health insurers in the United States share information about their insurance plans, provider networks, and participating healthcare providers. It defines a FHIR-based API that allows third-party applications to access this data easily.

The standard focuses on key information like provider names, specialties, locations, and network affiliations. It uses specific profiles for FHIR resources such as Practitioner, Organization, Location, HealthcareService, and InsurancePlan, tailoring them to the needs of payer directories.

By standardizing this information, the guide enables the development of tools that help patients find in-network healthcare services. It also assists providers in identifying other in-network professionals for referrals and care coordination.

The standard aligns with [US Core](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/hl7.fhir.us.core) profiles, promoting compatibility with other US healthcare systems. It also includes privacy considerations, specifying that the service should not require authentication or store identifying information about users.

Health plans, application developers, patients, and healthcare providers all stand to benefit from this standardized approach to sharing provider directory information.
