This standard aims to streamline the process for patients to request corrections to their medical records electronically. It replaces fragmented, manual, and paper-based correction processes with a more efficient and automated approach.

The standard introduces a FHIR-based method for communicating correction requests between patient applications and healthcare provider systems. It uses FHIR Communication and Task resources to manage requests and track their progress. A specific operation, '$correction-request', is defined to initiate and update requests.

Key features include standardized workflows, improved automation, and enhanced transparency. Patients can track the status of their correction requests, providing greater visibility into the process. The standard also establishes clear linkages between different resources to maintain context and track conversations.

This approach benefits patients by offering an easier and more transparent process for correcting errors in their medical records. Healthcare providers can expect reduced administrative burden and improved efficiency in handling correction requests. Developers of patient-facing applications and EHR vendors can implement this standard to support electronic correction requests in a consistent manner.

The standard aligns with patient rights outlined in HIPAA and GDPR regulations, particularly concerning data correction and amendment.
