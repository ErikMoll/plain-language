This standard aims to improve the exchange of dental health information between medical and dental providers in the United States. It defines a structured format for sharing dental referral and consultation notes, enabling seamless communication between electronic health record (EHR) and dental record systems.

The standard addresses four common scenarios: medical to dental referrals, dental to medical consultations, and dental to dental referrals. It incorporates dental-specific data concepts and terminology, allowing for more comprehensive and detailed information exchange compared to previous approaches.

Key features include defined profiles for dental referrals, consultations, and findings, as well as value sets for dental anatomy, procedures, and reasons for referral. The standard leverages existing healthcare data exchange frameworks and dental terminology systems to ensure compatibility and accuracy.

Medical and dental providers benefit from improved care coordination and efficiency. EHR system developers gain clear guidelines for implementing dental data exchange functionality. Payers can access enhanced data for claims processing and quality measurement.

By standardizing dental data exchange, this FHIR-based standard supports initiatives promoting oral health integration into primary care and contributes to value-based care efforts.
