This standard aims to improve how healthcare payers and providers exchange Member Attribution Lists in the United States. These lists are crucial for managing patients under value-based care arrangements, where providers are responsible for the quality and cost of care for specific patients.

The standard introduces several key features to streamline the process:

1. It defines a common structure for representing Member Attribution Lists using FHIR.
2. It establishes APIs for exchanging lists and requesting changes, allowing for automated updates.
3. It incorporates real-time notifications of list changes.
4. It utilizes SMART on FHIR for secure access to patient data.
5. It supports bulk data exchange for efficiently handling large lists.
6. It enables providers to create and propose attribution lists to payers.

These features help payers create and distribute lists more efficiently, while providers can access up-to-date information on their attributed patients. This improved process supports better care coordination, quality reporting, and cost management in value-based care programs.

The standard aligns with healthcare interoperability efforts and supports compliance with regulations like HIPAA. It also addresses use cases related to CMS initiatives that promote FHIR for data exchange.
