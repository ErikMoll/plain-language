This standard aims to improve maternal and child health research in the United States by creating a unified approach to exchanging healthcare data. It addresses the challenge of rising maternal mortality rates and scattered data across different systems.

The standard defines a consistent format for representing maternal and child health information using FHIR resources. It establishes a clear method for linking mothers' records with their children's, enabling researchers to analyze data from both perspectives. The standard supports querying specific data elements and retrieving complete patient records, offering flexibility for various research needs.

Key features include the use of Clinical Quality Language to define specific research populations, such as mothers who died within a year of pregnancy. It also incorporates measure evaluation capabilities to assess these populations and generate reports.

Researchers are the primary beneficiaries, gaining access to standardized and linked data for their studies. EHR vendors and developers need to implement the standard's specifications to enable data exchange. Public health agencies may use it to analyze population health trends and inform interventions.

The standard aligns with US Core profiles and incorporates Vital Records Common Profiles for record linkage, ensuring compatibility with national data exchange standards.
