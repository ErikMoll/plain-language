The HotBeverage FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) is a satirical document that humorously proposes standards for automating the brewing of hot beverages like coffee and tea. This fictional guide draws inspiration from the Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol (HTCPCP/1.0) and its extension for tea appliances, HTCPCP-TEA.

In this imagined scenario, the IG outlines how to fulfill device requests for crafting expertly brewed caffeinated drinks. It envisions a system where users can send specific instructions to devices—such as coffee pots or tea kettles—to prepare beverages with desired additives like milk, sweeteners, or spices. The guide also humorously addresses error codes, including the playful "418 I'm a teapot," indicating a device's inability to brew coffee due to its teapot nature.

While the HotBeverage FHIR IG is not intended for actual implementation, it serves as a lighthearted exploration of how standardized protocols could, in theory, be applied to everyday tasks like beverage preparation. This satirical approach offers a creative perspective on the potential of interoperability standards beyond traditional healthcare applications.
