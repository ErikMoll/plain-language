This standard aims to define consistent functionality for Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems. It provides a comprehensive list of functions organized into seven sections, covering areas like care provision, population health support, and record infrastructure. The standard uses FHIR Requirements resources to structure its content.

Key features include functional profiles for tailoring the function list to specific care settings, conformance criteria for implementation and evaluation, and a structured language with a comprehensive glossary. The standard aligns with international regulations and incorporates updates like ISO 21089:2018 alignment for trusted information flow.

The standard benefits software developers, healthcare providers, and policymakers. Developers gain guidance for creating EHRs with standardized functionality. Healthcare providers get a clear understanding of EHR capabilities for improved care delivery. Policymakers receive a framework for defining EHR requirements and promoting interoperability in healthcare systems.

By standardizing EHR functionality, this standard aims to enhance patient safety, improve care quality, and streamline healthcare processes.
