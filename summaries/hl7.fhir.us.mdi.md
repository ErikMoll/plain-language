This standard aims to improve the exchange of information related to death investigations in the United States. It focuses on enabling efficient data sharing between medical examiner and coroner offices, toxicology labs, and death registration systems.

The standard defines how to structure and transmit key information such as investigation findings, toxicology results, and PDF reports. It aligns with existing US healthcare data standards to ensure compatibility with other systems.

By standardizing data exchange, this guide helps streamline death investigation processes, reduce manual data entry, and improve the accuracy of information. It supports more timely and accurate reporting, benefiting public health and safety agencies that rely on this data.

Medical examiners, coroners, death investigators, and software developers working on related systems are the primary users of this standard. While not directly impacting patients, it contributes to more effective death investigations and reporting, which can benefit families and communities.

The standard also addresses privacy and security concerns, ensuring sensitive information is protected during transmission between systems.
