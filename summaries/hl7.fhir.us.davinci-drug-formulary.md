This standard aims to improve how health insurers in the United States share drug formulary information. A drug formulary is a list of medications covered by a health plan, including details on costs and coverage. The standard uses FHIR to create a structured, machine-readable format for formulary data, making it easier for consumers and applications to access and analyze this information.

Key features include specific profiles for insurance plans and medications, custom extensions for formulary-specific details, and search parameters to help find relevant information. The standard also provides guidance on efficiently retrieving large formulary datasets.

By adopting this standard, health insurers can publish their formularies in a consistent, accessible way. This benefits consumers by allowing them to easily compare medication costs across different plans and potentially find lower-cost alternatives. Third-party developers can create applications that use this standardized formulary data to offer cost comparisons and other valuable services.

The standard aligns with US regulatory requirements, particularly those related to Qualified Health Plans on the federal health insurance marketplace. It also relies on RxNorm, a standardized nomenclature for medications, to identify drugs consistently.
