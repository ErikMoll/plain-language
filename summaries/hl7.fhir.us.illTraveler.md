This standard aims to improve the reporting of ill travelers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States, specifically for Air Contact Investigations (ACIs). ACIs identify and notify passengers who may have been exposed to communicable diseases during air travel.

The standard introduces a structured approach using FHIR resources to streamline data sharing between the CDC's Division of Global Migration Health and jurisdictional health departments. It addresses limitations in current methods that became apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Key features include standardized data exchange for traveler demographics, travel history, symptoms, and lab results. The standard also incorporates electronic case reporting to facilitate timely submission of case data to public health agencies.

By reducing manual processes and inconsistencies, this standard aims to speed up processing times and enhance the effectiveness of ACIs. It integrates with the CDC Front Door, a single entry point for submitting public health data to the CDC.

Primary beneficiaries include public health agencies who can conduct ACIs more efficiently. The standard aligns with broader public health reporting goals, supporting disease surveillance and outbreak management efforts.
