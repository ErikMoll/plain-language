This standard aims to improve how clinical decision support (CDS) tools work with EHRs and other healthcare systems. It introduces "hooks" - specific points in a clinician's workflow where CDS services can be triggered to provide timely advice or recommendations.

The standard defines a consistent way for CDS services to integrate with clinical systems. It uses "cards" to present information and suggestions to clinicians in a standardized format. The system can also prefetch relevant patient data to optimize performance.

For more complex decision support, the standard allows CDS services to launch interactive applications. It incorporates security measures like OAuth 2.0 and JWT for safe communication between CDS clients and services.

This approach benefits CDS developers by providing a framework for building and deploying services. EHR vendors gain a standardized integration method. Clinicians receive seamless access to decision support within their workflows, potentially enhancing patient care.
