This standard focuses on managing alerts and notifications from medical devices. It defines how to represent and exchange device alert information using FHIR. The standard is designed for scenarios such as remote patient monitoring or hospital device integration where timely communication of device data is crucial.

The DeviceAlerting standard includes a patient profile that extends the basic FHIR Patient resource, potentially adding device-related information or alert preferences. This patient-centric approach allows for customization of alert management based on individual needs.

Key users of this standard include software developers who implement systems for sending, receiving, and processing device alerts. Healthcare providers benefit from standardized alerts, enabling efficient patient monitoring and timely responses to critical events. The standard's use of FHIR promotes interoperability in healthcare data exchange.

By providing a consistent framework for device alerting, this standard aims to improve patient safety and care quality through more effective management of medical device notifications.
