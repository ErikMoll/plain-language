This standard aims to improve the exchange of laboratory test results in the United States healthcare system. It provides detailed guidelines for representing different types of lab results, including numerical values, positive/negative results, text descriptions, scales, and ratios. The standard uses FHIR to define specific profiles for each result type, ensuring consistent data representation across different healthcare systems.

Key features include the use of LOINC codes to identify lab tests, predefined value sets for coded results, and guidance on handling document-based results. The standard also addresses security considerations, emphasizing compliance with HIPAA regulations.

Health IT developers are the primary users of this standard, as it provides clear specifications for implementing lab data exchange. Healthcare providers benefit from improved access to standardized lab results from various sources, potentially leading to better-informed clinical decisions.

The standard aligns with the United States Core Data for Interoperability ([USCDI](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/hl7.fhir.us.core)) by using LOINC codes for observation types. It offers a structured approach to lab data exchange, enhancing interoperability in the U.S. healthcare system.
